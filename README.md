## Repository Overview

Currently completed projects include:

* **oscilloscope\_fpga**
  A real-time oscilloscope implemented on an FPGA, which interfaces with a Python script for live data visualization. The data transmission is trigger-based: it uses a customizable trigger condition to capture a frame of data and sends it via UART. This project demonstrates signal capture, digital processing, and visualization, showcasing my expertise in Verilog HDL, FPGA design, and real-time system integration.

* **drop\_test\_ar200**
  A project using an ESP32 with the Arduino framework to provide Bluetooth control of a solenoid-based control circuit. The system sampled displacement in increments of 8 microns, enabling precise measurements for drop test analysis. This project emphasizes embedded system integration and fine-grained data acquisition.

Each project contains its own directory with source files and detailed instructions.
